Dear Prof. Kuan,

The third talk of the NCU-Delta online talk series will be held on 8PM
(TAIWAN LOCAL TIME, GMT+8), JUNE 16, 2021. The talk will be given by
Prof. Nissim Kanekar from NCRA-TIFA. The details can be found as
follows:

_Title: _
_Atomic Gas in Star-forming Galaxies at High Redshifts_
_ _

_Abstract:_
_Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) is the primary fuel for star formation,
and an important_
_component of galaxies. Understanding the evolution of the cold neutral
gas in galaxies is _
_critical in understanding galaxy evolution. Unfortunately, little is
known about the HI _
_content of galaxies at even moderate redshifts, z>~0.3, due to the
weakness of the HI 21cm _
_line, the main tracer of the atomic component. For large galaxy
samples, ``stacking'' of _
_the redshifted HI 21cm emission allows us to achieve a far better HI
mass sensitivity _
_for the population than would be possible for individual objects. In
this talk, I will _
_describe our recent results from such HI 21cm stacking experiments,
using upgraded Giant _
_Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21cm spectroscopy of the DEEP2 Survey
fields to probe the _
_atomic gas mass and gas properties of star-forming galaxies out to
z~1.5. _
