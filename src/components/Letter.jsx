                        Dear Astronomers and Astrophysicists,<br /><br />
                        An email network (TAN: Taiwan Astronomy Network) has been set up for all professional astronomers/astrophysicists in Taiwan or related to Taiwan. The aim of this network is to increase the communication among us in an INFORMAL way. TAN was designed to act just like a real-time open forum and your messages would be distributed to all subscribers automatically. A good example of the usage of TAN is information exchange. As mentioned, this is not an official network, so fell free to bring up anything you think is relevant to astronomy in Taiwan. However, since May 2002, the auto-forward function of TAN was forced to be disabled due to increasingly more virus attacks and SPAM mails. Currently, TAN is moderated mildly to ensure no virus or SPAM mails get to our readers. As a result, TAN is now issued at an irregular interval ranging from a day to a couple of weeks.<br /><br />
                        If you are interested in subscribing it, please email <b>kuan@ntnu.edu.tw</b> for details. Please give a short description of your professional background. Graduate students in astronomy/astrophysics/physics programs are also welcome.<br /><br />
                        Comment? Suggestion? PLEASE PASS THE WORDS OF THE EXISTENCE OF TAN TO PEOPLE YOU THINK WHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED. To keep TAN alive, active participation from all subscribers are needed. Please GIVE IT A TRY? Hope we can hear from you very soon.
